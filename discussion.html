              <p>In this study, the soda taxes did not have any impact on the diabetes or obesity outcomes with coefficients close to zero and no statistical significance. Conversely, other variables had stronger predictive powers such as having a job leading to a lessening of diabetes incidence and the same for being female with obesity. Since the primary focus of this study was the soda tax, the findings of this study did not support junk food taxes as an effective intervention. The results mirror what other studies said about it not having enough impact on its own. Also, this type of intervention uses regressive taxation that limits the purchasing power of US constituents, especially those of lower socioeconomic status. If the public health impacts do not improve, it might not be worth it to limit the public in such a way because of the risk of adverse effects like increased food insecurity. That said, the scope of this study was not enough to make any conclusive statements on the issue.

                One of the limitations of this study was the small sample size, the OLS regressions only had 51 observations per year and with the combined years in the panel data, it only aggregated to 102 observations. In the future it would be beneficial to attempt this study at the county level although it might be difficult to get BRFSS county level data. Similarly, it would be good to expand the range of years. Initially, this study had chosen to focus on food prices rather than a food price-related intervention. However, there was not such available data at the state level. It would be interesting to see that type of study. Similarly, it would be good to get a more thorough update with more available years of data to compare. There can be a focus on other types of junk food taxes as well. Finally, there was not as much data supporting the efficacy of healthy food subsidies so an inverse of this study would be an interesting direction.
