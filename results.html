              <p>Looking at the output for the simple linear regressions in figures 1 and 2, soda tax was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of diabetes or obesity. The same was true for the panel data regressions in figure 3. According to the correlations in figure 7, obesity and diabetes in the sample were strongly positively correlated at 0.829 on a scale of -1 to 1. Despite the strong positive relationship, the regressions have slightly opposing signs on their coefficients although close to 0. 
                <br>

                Interestingly, having an income of $35,000 or more had a slight positive relationship with the incidence of diabetes and obesity. That could be because the income cut off was too low to effectively examine people of low socioeconomic status versus those not. Its relationship is not strong enough to be statistically significant for 2008 or in the panel data regressions (see figures 1, 3,). The income variable was very statistically significant for the 2018 OLS regression, meaning it was significant at the 1% significance level (see figure 2). 
                <br>
                
                Being above the age of 65 years old was statistically significant at the 1% significance level for diabetes in the year 2008 but not at all significant for the year 2018 or for either year for obesity for the OLS regressions. Its results were the inverse of the prior mentioned income variable. This is one of the most statistically significant predictor variables in the panel regression (see figure 3). It was statistically significant at the 1% level for the regular panel regression for diabetes and obesity, and the fixed effects regression for obesity. It was significant at the 5% level for the random effect regression for obesity. Considering that the correlation with both obesity and diabetes for age over 65 is over 0.54 for both, it makes sense that age would be a good predictor for these lifestyle diseases (see figure 7).
                <br>
                
                What is interesting for the Hispanic variable is that it has an inverse relationship with both diabetes and obesity. Asian also had that at the 1% significant level for the obesity OLS in 2008 and all of the obesity panel regressions. Having a high proportion of people who identify as Asian seem to be a strong predictor of lower obesity rates. That was not the case for diabetes. Conversely, people who identify as Black are statistically significant at the 5% level for obesity for the 2018 OLS and the panel data regression for fixed effects with a positive relationship. That mean a 1 unit increase in Black people is related to a 0.122 unit increase in obesity for the fixed effects regression. 
                <br>
                
                Much like the other variables, the coefficient for Native American or Indigenous had opposing signs for diabetes and obesity. It had a negative relationship with diabetes and a positive one with obesity. That means that higher proportions of Native Americans are associated with lower incidence of diabetes and higher incidence of obesity. These results are significant at the 5% level for the 2008 OLS for both obesity and diabetes and for obesity regular panel and random effect regressions. It is significant at the 1% level for the diabetes panel data except for the fixed effect. 
                <br>
                
                As expected, having a college education or higher was associated with lower incidence of diabetes and obesity. This result was consistent with the literature. The relationship was statistically significant at the 5% significance level for the 2008 Diabetes OLS, meaning that for a 1 unit increase in college educated people, there was a 0.053 unit decrease in diabetes. Similarly, there was the same significance for this variable for the panel data random effects regression. 
                <br>
                Although physical activity had a consistently negative relationship with both diabetes and obesity (see figures 1, 2, & 3), this variable had no statistical significance and the coefficient magnitudes were fairly small. Similarly, smoking did not have any visible trends except for its coefficients being negative for all of the panel data regressions. It did not have any statistical significance for any of the regressions. 
                <br>
                
                One of the more surprising results was the strong relationship between female and obesity. Compared to diabetes that had a positive relationship, obesity had a negative one. At the 1% level were all of the obesity regressions except for the 2018 OLS, which was only significant at the 5% level. More than that, the coefficients are some of the largest in the sample. For a 1 unit increase in the proportion of females, there was a 1.3 to 1.8 unit decrease in the incidence of obesity. This result is consistent with current national data in which 43% of men were obese while only 41% women were. (NIDDK 2020) 
                <br>
                
                Having a job was statistically significant at the 1% level with a negative relationship for almost all of the regressions for diabetes (see figures 1, 2, & 3). The coefficients for this variable were also somewhat bigger in magnitude than the other variables but not to the point of female variable.
                The Hausman Test (see figures 11 & 12) failed to reject the null hypothesis when comparing the results from the fixed effects regressions and the random effects regressions for both diabetes and obesity. Based on those results, it is better to look at the results from the random effects regression rather than the fixed effects regressions because it would be more reliable.</p>
